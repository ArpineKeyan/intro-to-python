    "## Quick Introduction to the Shell\n",
    "\n",
    "A full intro to using the shell/terminal/command-line is well beyond the scope of this chapter, but for the uninitiated we will offer a quick introduction here.\n",
    "The shell is a way to interact textually with your computer.\n",
    "Ever since the mid 1980s, when Microsoft and Apple introduced the first versions of their now ubiquitous graphical operating systems, most computer users have interacted with their operating system through familiar clicking of menus and drag-and-drop movements.\n",
    "But operating systems existed long before these graphical user interfaces, and were primarily controlled through sequences of text input: at the prompt, the user would type a command, and the computer would do what the user told it to.\n",
    "Those early prompt systems are the precursors of the shells and terminals that most active data scientists still use today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Someone unfamiliar with the shell might ask why you would bother with this, when many results can be accomplished by simply clicking on icons and menus.\n",
    "A shell user might reply with another question: why hunt icons and click menus when you can accomplish things much more easily by typing?\n",
    "While it might sound like a typical tech preference impasse, when moving beyond basic tasks it quickly becomes clear that the shell offers much more control of advanced tasks, though admittedly the learning curve can intimidate the average computer user.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, here is a sample of a Linux/OSX shell session where a user explores, creates, and modifies directories and files on their system (``osx:~ $`` is the prompt, and everything after the ``$`` sign is the typed command; text that is preceded by a ``#`` is meant just as description, rather than something you would actually type in):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ml-02:~ $ echo \"hello world\"             # echo is like Python's print function\n",
    "hello world\n",
    "\n",
    "ml-02:~ $ pwd                            # pwd = print working directory\n",
    "/home/ml-02/Learning/Command_line      # this is the \"path\" that we're sitting in\n",
    "\n",
    "ml-02:~ $ ls                             # ls = list working directory contents\n",
    "notebooks  projects Shell.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "ml-02:Command_line$ cd projects/                   # cd = change directory\n",

    "ml-02:projects $ pwd\n",

    "\n",

    "project1   project2   myproject.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "ml-02:projects $ mkdir myproject          # mkdir = make new directory\n",
    "\n",
    "ml-02:projects $ cd myproject/\n",
    "\n",
    "ml-02:myproject $ mv ../myproject.txt ./  # mv = move file. Here we're moving the\n",
    "                                        # file myproject.txt from one directory\n",
    "                                        # up (../) to the current directory (./)\n",
    "ml-02:myproject $ ls\n",
    "myproject.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that all of this is just a compact way to do familiar operations (navigating a directory structure, creating a directory, moving a file, etc.) by typing commands rather than clicking icons and menus.\n",
    "Note that with just a few commands (``pwd``, ``ls``, ``cd``, ``mkdir``, and ``cp``) you can do many of the most common file operations.\n",
    "It's when you go beyond these basics that the shell approach becomes really powerful.\n"
